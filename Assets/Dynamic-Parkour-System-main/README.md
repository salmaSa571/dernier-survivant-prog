![](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System/blob/Git-Pages/docs/Resources/Card.png)

Dynamic Parkour System is a FREE plugin  for Unity that allows anyone to import any model and have an already working controller with parkour capabilities like in Assassin's Creed and Uncharted games. This package is fully customizable with its own Character Controller, being really easy to configure and fast to use. It has the possibility to choose between some already build-in Parkour Actions.
